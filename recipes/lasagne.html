        Lasagna Recipe:

        Ingredients:
        450g ground beef or Italian sausage
        1 onion, diced
        3 cloves garlic, minced
        1 (800g) can crushed tomatoes
        1 (170g) can tomato paste
        2 tsp dried oregano
        1 tsp dried basil
        2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) salt
        1.25 ml (1/4 tsp) black pepper
        9 lasagna noodles
        1 (425g) container ricotta cheese
        1 egg
        2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) salt
        200g shredded mozzarella cheese
        120g grated Parmesan cheese
        
        Instructions:
        Preheat oven to 190Â°C.
        In a large skillet, cook the ground beef or sausage over medium heat until browned, 5-7 minutes. Drain excess
        fat.
        Add the onion and garlic to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes until softened.
        Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) salt, and black pepper. Simmer for
        10 minutes.
        Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.
        In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, egg, and 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) salt.
        Spread 250 ml (1 cup) of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 23x33 cm baking dish.
        Arrange 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, then top
        with 100 g of mozzarella cheese.
        Repeat the layers of noodles, ricotta, and mozzarella.
        Top with the remaining 3 noodles and the remaining meat sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
        Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
        Let the lasagna stand for 15 minutes before serving.
