        Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe:

        Ingredients:
        280g all-purpose flour
        5 ml (1 tsp) baking soda
        5 ml (1 tsp) salt
        225g unsalted butter, softened
        150g granulated sugar
        150g packed brown sugar
        5 ml (1 tsp) vanilla extract
        2 large eggs
        350g semi-sweet chocolate chips
        
        Instructions:
        Preheat oven to 190Â°C. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
        In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
        In a large bowl, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.
        Beat in the vanilla and then the eggs one at a time until combined.
        Gradually stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips.
        Scoop the dough by rounded tablespoons onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 5 cm apart.
        Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden brown.
        Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool
        completely.
